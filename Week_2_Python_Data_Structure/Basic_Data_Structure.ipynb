First of all, many people refer the Python \"list\" as an array in other programming language, however, You should know that the Python \"list\" is a much flexible and powerful data structure compares to an array in different programming language.  A \"tuple', on the other hand, is basically an **immutable** list.  We are going to discuss some situation when we need an immutable list, tuple.  \n",

    "In this section, we discuss the common **methods** of list **object**. To programming beginners, the concept of **method** could be very vague. If we image a Python **object** is actually a physical object, **method** is bacially the action of the **object**.  It's similar to when we are using a **verb** pair with a **noun** in a sentence.  Python is an object oriented program.  A method defines the behavior of the object and is an actiona that an object is able to perform.\n",

    "A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.  Python set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.  A set can be created by placing a comma-separated list of elements within braces (or curly brackets).  We can use Since sets are unordered, we cannot access items using index or slice like we do in lists or tuples. Some of the operations we used on lists or tuples still apply to the sets.  Here are some operation examples.\n",

    "# We can use remove( ) function to remove element from a set\n",
