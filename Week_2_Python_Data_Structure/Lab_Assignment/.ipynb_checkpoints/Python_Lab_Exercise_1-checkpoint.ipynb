    "- Classifying and explaining data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, dictionaries, and tuples)\n",
    "- Identifying comparators and boolean operators to create conditional code\n",
    "- Making use of lists: indexing, appending, and joining them\n",
    "- Making use of dictionaries: identifying, creating, and navigating them\n",
    "- Moving between lists and dictionaries (zipping lists together to make dictionaries, or pulling relevant data from a dictionary into a list)\n",
    "- Applying for loops to lists and dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Some new things we're bringing up that weren't covered in class:\n",
